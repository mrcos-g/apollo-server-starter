# Apollo Server Starter

Apollo Server Starter aims to help you get your server up and running faster.

### Tech

Apollo Server Starter uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [TypeScript] - Typed superset of JavaScript
- [Apollo Server] - GraphQL Server
- [TypeGraphQL] - Framework developed to help you build your GraphQL API with TypeScript.
- [TypeORM] - ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
- [webpack] - Static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications

### Installation

Apollo Server Starter uses [node.js] v12.18.1 to run.

We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) to manage node.js versions

Install Yarn

```sh
$ brew install yarn
```

Install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```sh
$ yarn install
```

This project uses [dotenv] to load environmental variables from a `.env` file located in the root directory. Please create your own with the following variables for the `ormconfig.js` file.

- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_NAME`

Keep in mind that this project was also built using [Postgres] as the database of choice. You can choose a different option but this may require some changes to the `ormconfig.js` set up. Please look at the [TypeORM configuration options] and adjust based on your selection. You may also need to install a different database client for node.js instead of [node-postgres].

### Development

Run in development mode

```sh
yarn start:dev
```

Run ESLint and Prettier on all TypeScript files under src/

```sh
yarn lint
```

### Production

Build for production to the build/ folder

```sh
yarn build
```
